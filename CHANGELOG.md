* Performance improvement for visibility checker that is used for grey_tap(), grey_sufficientlyVisible(), etc.
* Error logs are now more concise and clear.
* Miscellaneous synchronization improvements related to scroll views, timers and network tracking.
* All EarlGrey interactions from the test side now work on a separate background queue.

### Known Issues

* ASAN, UBSAN and TSAN do not work with EarlGrey at the moment.
